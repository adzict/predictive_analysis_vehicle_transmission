# Predictive Analysis for Vehicle Transmission Detection

The primary goal of this project was to predict vehicle transmission type, if it is a manual transmission type
or automatic, by leveraging a dataset that is comprised of 11 features and 32 data instances. Potential
implications of this project's results could yield a significant influence to key aspects of vehicle design, fuel
efficiency, customer preferences, cost optimisations, as well as research and development, to name a few.
The project consisted of several phases, with the initial phase being dataset exploration, and the final phase
being predictive modeling recommendations.

## Data

The source of the dataset is from the 1974 Motor Trend US magazine, and comprises fuel consumption and
10 aspects of automobile design and performance for 32 automobiles (1973–74 models).

- am - transmission type, automatic or manual
- mpg - fuel efficiency that indicates how many miles the vehicle can travel on a single gallon of fuel
- cyl - the number of cylinders in the vehicle's engine, where the higher number means a more
powerful engine
- disp - engine displacement which indicates the volume of engine’s cylinders, where a higher
displacement usually indicates a more powerful engine
- hp - horsepower refers to the power output of the engine
- drat - the rear axle ratio represents the ratio of the number of revolutions of the drive shaft to the
rear axle's revolutions, where a higher ratio leads to higher acceleration, but lower ratio leads to
better fuel efficiency at higher speeds
- wt - weight signifies vehicle’s mass, and it influences many aspects of vehicle performance: fuel
efficiency, handling, power
- qsec - the time it takes for the vehicle to cover a quarter-mile distance from a standstill, measuring
acceleration, where lower qsec indicates quicker acceleration
- vs - engine types shown as V-shaped (V-engine) or straight (inline) based on the configuration of
cylinders
- gear - number of gears in the vehicle's transmission
- carb - the number of carburetors in the vehicle which can impact engine performance and fuel
efficiency
